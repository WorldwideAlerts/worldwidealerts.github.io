                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>March 11, 2020 the Coronavirus was declared a global pandemic. These past two years were 
                    harrowing due to this ghastly virus. Paranoia haunted the lives of everyone around the 
                    globe; young and old. A global lockdown; a once in a lifetime experience. Every single face,
                    covered by an N95 mask. The lockdown began and it felt like house arrest. What seemed to be 
                    the apocalypse was turning the human race against each other as brawls broke out in local 
                    supermarkets over toilet paper. This period of time was straight out of a horror story that 
                    has now engraved itself into the history books. In 2022, we are happy to report that 
                    coronavirus cases have steadily declined and things are starting to return to normal. 
                    Or we thought. Jul 23, 2022; the monkeypox was declared a public health emergency. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="background">
                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>The monkeypox virus is the predecessor of the poxvirus family. The poxvirus family has 
                    83 different viruses, the most infamous being monkeypox, and smallpox. Despite the recent 
                    outbreak bringing this virus into the spotlight, it has actually been around for quite some
                    time just like many other viruses. The first case of monkeypox was reported in 1970. Yes, 
                    that is correct. The first case was 52 years ago back when the most influential band of 
                    all time, the Beatles, had just broken up. The origin of the virus is still unknown and 
                    contrary to popular belief it is not from monkeys. The 2022 outbreak was rather unexpected
                    as it reached numerous countries that's never reported any cases of this virus. The 
                    spread of the virus is through close intimate contact with a person or animal that has 
                    the virus. As of today, August 16th, 2022, there are a reported 38,000 cases of this 
                    virus and 12 deaths. The fatality rate of the virus is low but it is still important to 
                    educate yourself about it. 
                </p>
            </div>  
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h1>Symptoms</h1>
                <p>Symptoms for the monkeypox virus are not noticeable until 1 to 3 weeks after exposure.<br> 
                    Like stated in the previous paragraph the only way of getting this virus is through 
                    intimate/close contact<br>with any person or animal that is infected with the virus. 
                    Intimate contact with another individual includes:<br> sexual orientation, hugging, massaging,
                    kissing, and sharing of any bodily fuid. Also, it is suggested you take<br>precautions when 
                    touching the objects used by a person who has the virus as they must be disinfected or<br> 
                    those objects also have a chance of spreading the virus. There are different levels to 
                    the symptoms.<br>Starting off with level 1 is the flu like symptoms which are fevers, 
                    headaches, and fatigue which could easily<br>be the cause of some other factor. Level 2 
                    includes chills and swollen lymph nodes; these should alert you<br>but are not enough to 
                    fully confirm it is monkeypox. Last but not least, level 3 is rashes that turn into bumps<br>
                    located on various parts of the body such as feet, hands, chest, face, mouth, and 
                    genitals. These rashes also<br>include scabs. If an individual has these symptoms they 
                    should get tested by a healthcare professional.<br>The test can either be a blood test or 
                    microscopic inspection of bodily fluid.  These symptoms typically last<br>2 to 4 weeks. 
                    In this time span the rash will be fully healed and the damaged skin will be replaced by 
                    a new<br>layer of skin that forms in response to the damage.  
                </p>

            <div class="treatments">
                <h1>Treatments</h1>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, there is no treatment directly for the monkeypox virus. There are 
                    currently two vaccines that have been approved to treat the monkeypox vaccine: the JYNNEOS 
                    vaccine and the ACAM2000 vaccine. These vaccines were known to treat other viruses from the
                    poxvirus family and health professionals hope it can do the same for the monkeypox virus. 
                    These two vaccines have never been tested for how efficient it is at treating this virus 
                    but it is recommended in certain cases. It is very much possible to heal in the 2 to 4 
                    week span without receiving any professional treatment as it is not as extreme or vicious 
                    as other viruses but as a whole it is our responsibility to educate ourselves and stop the
                    spread. Last but not least, antivirals such as tecovirimat (TPOXX) are also recommended. 
                    Yet again this was used to treat other viruses from the poxvirus family and are not 
                    directly made for the monkeypox virus. It is important those with the virus isolate 
                    themselves from others and maintain proper hygiene to help the healing process.
