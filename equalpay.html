                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>‚ÄúEveryone thinks women should be thrilled when we get crumbs, and I want women to have 
                        the cake, the icing and the cherry on top, too.‚Äù - Billie Jean King, a tennis legend 
                        who led the charge for pay equality in her sport. Equal pay is one of the biggest 
                        struggles society has not been able to overcome to this day. There are many examples of
                        the wage gap in various careers. Let's take into consideration professional sports, as
                        we have already mentioned Billie Jean King. A noteworthy field is professional 
                        basketball. For instance, ‚ÄúThe average NBA base salary this season is about $5.4 
                        million, compared with about $120,600 for the WNBA‚Äù (Wamsley). Professional 
                        basketball is a prime example of the wage gap, and more of a reason to fight for 
                        pay equality. Some seem to think the wage gap doesn't exist or is insignificant; 
                        a 44:1 ratio proves otherwise. The gender wage gap is concerned with the difference 
                        in income between women and men in the same occupation. The gender wage gap exists 
                        around the world, far worse than what we have seen from just professional basketball. </p>

                    <h1>Statistics</h1>
                    <p>	The wage gap is extremely severe in Eastern countries. For example, ‚Äúwomen in Pakistan<br> 
                        earn 34% less than men on average. The same report also found women in Pakistan 
                        constitute 90% of <br>the bottom 1% of wage earners in the country‚Äù (Chaudhry). The trend 
                        seems to be that in countries where<br>church and state are not separated, the wage gap 
                        increases. Women have gone far too long without equal pay. <br>This is an issue that can't
                        be postponed. We need to take action against equal pay now! </p>

                    <h1>The Fight For Equality</h1>
                    <p>
                        In fact, there are examples of powerful women fighting for their economic equality.<br> 
                        For instance, ‚ÄúPatricia Arquette's Oscar speech this year, in which she referenced pay 
                        inequalities,<br> resulted in 320,000 tweets about #equalpay in two hours‚Äù (Ford). Social media
                        and the internet are<br> one of the leading factors in lifting women's voices and diminishing 
                        the wage gap that exists today. <br>Parity among male and female wages is something that 
                        we hope to see soon.
