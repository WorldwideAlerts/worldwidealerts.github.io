            <p>
                Uyghurs are an ethnic group who are predominantly Muslim, speak a Turkic language, and live 
                mainly in what is now the Xinjiang province in northwestern China. Unfortunately, since 2016, 
                the Chinese government has targeted the Uyghur people with a vast surveillance system, heavy 
                policing, mass detentions, and forced labor systems. It is estimated that more than 1 million 
                Uyghurs have been detained in a series of prison camps throughout the region. Eyewitnesses, 
                human rights experts and various countries acccuse the Chinese government of committing crimes 
                against humanity and genocide against the Uyghur people within these camps.

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                The Uyghurs are a Turkic ethnic group originating from and culturally affiliated with the 
                general region of Central and East Asia. The Uyghurs are recognized as native to the Xinjiang 
                Uyghur Autonomous Region in Northwest China. They are one of China's 55 officially recognized 
                ethnic minorities. The Uyghurs are recognized by the Chinese government as a regional minority 
                and the titular people of Xinjiang.	Recently, the Uyghur people have been imprisoned in 
                concentration camps due to the widespread of negative views and attitudes towards Muslims in 
                China, as even some Muslim communities in China face legal restrictions on their ability to 
                practice. The camps set up by the Chinese government have a cruel motive to try and attempt to 
                revert the Uyghurs from their Islamic faith with the use of inhumane methods.

            <h1>The Cruelty of the Camps</h1>
            <p>
                The prison/concentration camps withheld in China carry out the most vile and inhumane actions upon innocent people we have ever witnessed since the Nazis. These concentrations camps allow for internment, forced abortion, forced sterilization, forced labor, torture,
                brainwashing, and rape to occur to these innocent civilians who are only there due to China's 
                strong dislike to Muslims. Additionally, China reinforces their vicious and sickening mission to
                forcefully revert the Uyghur's from their Islamic faith by implementing surveillance and 
                policing tactics to enforce their banning of fasting during Ramadan, naming their children with
                traditional Muslim names, and wearing ‚Äúabnormal beards.‚Äù China has killed thousands of Muslims
                in this mass genocide and has been seen harvesting the Uyghur people's organs as well.

            <h1>How We Can Help</h1>
            <p>
                Students will learn about events such as the Holocaust in school and think to themselves that<br> 
                with the peace and safety instilled in our society in today's age, that such an event with a 
                similar magnitude<br> could never occur again. But unfortunately events of this magnitude are still
                 going on in cases such as the<br>Uyghur Muslims in China and it seems like it has just been swept
                  under the rug with no voices to speak up<br>for the inhumane internment and genocide of Uyghur 
                  Muslims. We begin helping by bringing light to this <br>issue and starting a #savetheuyghurs 
                  hashtag on all social media platforms to get the word out and educate<br>people on the barbaric
                   actions by the Chinese government in an effort to halt the genocide. Most importantly,<br>we 
                   can donate money to assist in stopping these vile actions against the Uyghurs at
